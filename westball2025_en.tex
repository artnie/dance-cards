% pstricks vs pgf/tikz:
% Originally we used pstricks to draw the background ornaments.
% This had the disadvantage of having to use `latex -> dvips -> ps2pdf` with the correct options to get the background
% graphics to display in the right orientation. The necessary options also varied between MiKTeX and TeXLive :-(.
%
% Since i have more experience with tikz, i decided to use that, because it was easier to position the
% elements (they weren't placed quite correctly with the pstricks version.).

% pgfornament vs eps files
% I wanted to use pgfornament at first because it has everything necessary in one easy package.
% Unfortunately the graphics in pgfornament end up having quite thick strokes. This does not look good at the scales
% we're using the patterns.
% So i downloaded the vectorian files and extracted the patterns manually with Inkscape. This probably leads to a slowdown though.
